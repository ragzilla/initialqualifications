Uses newman55's [UnityModManager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)

This mod will change the qualifications of your starting Doctor/Nurse/Assistant/Janitors, so you don't have to keep restarting to get good qualifications.  At this time the selections are hard coded into the mod, because I'm too lazy to figure out how to get GUILayout to be recognized on the TPH UnityEngine C# reference.
